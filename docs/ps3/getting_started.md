# Getting Started

## Requirements

* Understanding how [Command Prompt / `cmd`](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/) works and navigating folders with it.
* Windows
* At least 30-40Gbs of space for each game that you want to mod.
* Modded Console or [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net/). [MrMario2011 Has a good guide on that subject.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suM4dUAYUPE)
* Knowing how to FTP into your console.
* If modding GT6: [GT6 Mod Base](http://www.mediafire.com/folder/8d08of132m00y/GT6+Mod+Base) to use as base - extract it later on and use it to make your mod - **for 1.22/latest only.**

!!! warning "Important Notice if you are using a CFW console, or RPCS3"
    **Consider using FSRoot**

    [FSRoot](other/fsroot.md) is a method of running the game that allows editing the game files in real time by streaming files from your PC, And drastically helps modding/testing much more quickly.

    Requirements:

    * A PS3 with the REBUG 4.84 D-REX CFW is required
    * Kernel converted to DEX
    * EBOOT converted to Debug 
    * PS3 SDK available and installed on your PC (if no emulator).

    The requirements are a bit tedious to set-up, but all the more worth it.
