# SpecDB - Car Specification Database

!!! tip
    Refer to the [SpecDB](../../concepts/specdb.md) concept documentation first.

Gran Turismo 4 was the first game to use Polyphony's proprietary format for SpecDB, which can be edited with [GTSpecDB](https://github.com/Nenkai/GTSpecDB). It is also possible to convert said databases to SQLite for easier browsing.
