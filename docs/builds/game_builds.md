# Preface

This page attempts to list every single Gran Turismo game build - whether it has been dumped or not. The pages are ordered by build date.

Begin by browsing a game on the left-side of this screen.

!!! tip
    If you own any build not currently on this list, please contact [Nenkai](https://twitter.com/Nenkaai) or [Paiky](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/members/paiky.144636/)!

## Regarding debug symbols

Across the many builds on all platforms, no executable debug symbols were ever found (starting from PS3 it is mandatory for them to be stripped to past the certification process).

However debug symbols have been found for a prototype version of GTHD - presumably from a prototype PS3 devkit - origins unknown. They are available on [debugging.games](http://debugging.games).
