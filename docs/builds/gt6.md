:material-shovel: *Dumped*: {==Mostly==} - Korean versions missing.

The main build of Gran Turismo 6.

Compared to GT5, GT6 is internally a game that has been tidied up. More standard formats are in use and most bits that were previously hardcoded are no longer a concern. It's the first game to internally introduce [TinyWeb](../concepts/adhoc/tinyweb.md), used for some live events.
